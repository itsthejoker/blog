It's a single-file script that animates a lovely ocean scene using only text! Fish swim, a small castle chills out in the corner, and occasionally special events happen (watch for the shark and appearances of Nessie!). I ran it in a small terminal window every day around my normal work, enjoying it simply for being a quick escape from whatever problem I was working on at the time.","ASCIIQuarium screenshot courtesy of robobunny.com","During that time, I had an idea: use a low-power computer, an old display, and a bit of solder to create a permanent display for asciiquarium to have my very own digital fish tank that wouldn't need feeding (and had pretty colors)!

As an older TV, my connection options were limited to VGA, RCA, component, or S-Video. That wasn't a total killer though, because the Raspberry Pi 1 Model A (retro circa 2013!) has an RCA video out!","SparkFun Electronics from Boulder, USA - Raspberry Pi - Model A, CC BY 2.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=26785859","Our donor screen is an Emerson 22\" TV / DVD combo. It served a loyal life, delivering many marathons of the Lord of the Rings (extended editions!), but was eventually relegated to the garage. There's no remote anymore, so who knows what extra features it's supposed to have. What we care about, and what matters, is that when it turns on, it launches directly into Video 1 mode (where our RCA input is plugged in).","To power the Pi, I found an old Samsung phone charger that we don't have anymore and a no-brand micro-USB cable. After testing to ensure that it met the power requirements of the Pi, it was time to get the software sorted."]},{"l":"The Software","p":["ASCIIQuarium is a relatively small script written in Perl that only needs a little bit of setup in order to get working. The original source can be downloaded from Kirk Baucom's site, but the version I'm running is actually one that I edited myself to reduce the frequency of special events and make it more suited for this type of installation. The modified version can be downloaded from GitHub.","I want to give a major shout-out to the Raspberry Pi Foundation for their amazing support of old hardware; getting the Pi set up was a breeze by just downloading the latest command-line-only version of Raspbian and flashing it to an SD card using the new Raspberry Pi Imager.","Note: I ran into one issue with LC_LOCALES and other keys not being set correctly; running \"raspi-config\" and setting the locale information there fixed the problem after rebooting.","Perl is included in the default of Raspbian, so the only requirements we have are to install the curses library (a library that allows us to draw in the terminal) and install the Term::Animation package using Perl's CPAN command to actually handle the movements.","After cloning the repo, we can move into the folder ( cd asciiquarium) and make the program runnable with chmod +x asciiquarium. Running it by calling ./asciiqurium shows that it works and everything's animating! The last thing to do is make it run on startup, which is easily doable by adding an extra line to the .bash_profile file: /home/pi/asciiquarium/asciiquarium."]},{"l":"The Assembly","p":["Actually assembling everything is fairly straight-forward, but it did require some soldering. One of the things that I wanted for this build was that it would only require one cable; that meant that I had to wire the USB charger into the TV somehow. After cracking open the charger to free the circuit board, opening up the back of the TV (don't do this unless you know what you're doing!) showed that there was a great safe place to solder in the charger with access to the 120v power cable. Test fits and a little hot glue helped secure the charger in an out-of-the-way location on the main board of the TV.","One gutted charger in the guts of a TV!","With the USB power in place, only two things remain: securing the Pi to the back of the TV and getting it ready to install. The first was easy enough to solve with -- you guessed it -- more hot glue (though the Pi was placed into a case first!). The wiring was connected again to make sure it worked, and this is the wiring arrangement I came up with:","One acrylic case to the rescue for keeping my Pi safe!","After confirming that it worked as expected, the next step is to pull the SD card and back it up. This installation will be turned on and off by the power plug through a timer, so it's important to make the operating system read-only to guard against corruption. After making it read-only, no changes can be made -- so backing it up prior to performing that operation is critical.","Seriously, if you're following along, back up your SD card now. Take a full disk image using something like Win32Imager -- you don't want to make your OS read-only and THEN find out that something is wrong. You'd have to wipe it and start from scratch.","I used this article from Adafruit to actually perform the operation with the card plugged into a different Pi, and as far as I can tell it worked perfectly. When the SD card was slotted back into the Pi on the TV, everything worked perfectly!","...well, almost. It turns out that pretty much all TVs are designed so that when they're plugged in, they don't turn on automatically. This is a problem for this install because it'll be turned on and off by the timer. Thankfully, the internet comes through once more with a solution... involving more hot glue.","Yep.

That's the same concept that most consumer 3D printers operate on.","There are a lot of different options with what type of printer to use and what kind of material to use -- like types of fabric, there are hundreds of choices. For this, we'll only focus on the most common options.","You already know about printing on paper. 3D printing is a lot like that, but the result is a physical thing rather than text on a page. Instead of ink, a 3D printer uses plastic; instead of reproducing the text on a computer screen, a 3D printer reproduces a digital model that you process and download to it.","You can 3D print almost anything. Here are some examples:"]},{"l":"What You Need","p":["To get started with 3D printing, you'll need a handful of things:","a 3D printer","a computer","a way to get information from the computer to the printer -- options include:","USB cable","USB thumbdrive","SD card","Some printers can even connect to your local network!","a program called a slicer","material for the printer to use","patience","We're going to cover that list out of order because there are some terms that we have to get to first."]},{"l":"Patience","p":["Although it doesn't seem like it belongs there, you'll notice that patience is definitely on that list. 3D printing is a very cool process, but it's not a perfect process. There will be configurations that you have to modify, bolts that will need adjusting, bearings that will need oiling, and results that will need tweaking. This is just a part of the hobby, and if those things do not sound exciting or interesting, then this may not be the hobby for you.","It is worth noting that there are machines that don't require anywhere near as much maintenance / \"hand-holding\" in order to continue working, but they are usually several thousand dollars (or more). If you're approaching this from the hobbyist standpoint, at least some amount of tinkering will be required."]},{"l":"The Material That Gets Printed","p":["Material for 3D printing, called filament, is a very long connected line that is usually wound onto a spool. These spools are sold by weight in one (1) kilogram (2.2 lbs) rolls. The filament is sold in two diameters:","1.75mm diameter","Industry standard -- the majority of printers use this size","3mm diameter","This is older and not used as much anymore","Consumer 3D printing is entirely based in the metric system. Besides the fact that the metric system is very easy to use, 3D printing is heavily rooted in open source; the first open source 3D printer, the RepRap, was created in Bath, UK, in 2004.","The most common, beginner-friendly material to print with is known by its acronym: PLA. It's not very expensive, is easy to work with, and makes reasonably strong parts. There are many different options -- PETG and ABS are also popular, but they usually require some modifications / upgrades and special ventilation and temperature control to use properly."]},{"l":"The Slicer","p":["Though it has an ominous name, a slicer is a program that takes a digital model and converts it into instructions that the 3D printer can interpret. These instructions are very detailed and contain all the information needed for a specific 3D printer to build the model. Sliced files (the sets of instructions) are specific to the printer they're created for; if they're given to a different brand or build of printer, unexpected issues (or potentially damage to the printer) may occur.","Sliced files are known as gcode files; gcode is the instruction set that almost all 3D printers use. It's also used by some larger manufacturing tools, like automated mills and lathes. You can read more about gcode here if you're interested."]},{"l":"The Computer","p":["As long you have a computer or laptop (not a tablet or smartphone) that runs Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux, then you can find a slicer to use. The three most popular free slicers ( PrusaSlicer, Slic3r, and Cura) run on all three operating systems and are very forgiving on slower computers."]},{"l":"A 3D Printer","p":["The printer itself is where the magic happens -- where everything finally combines to produce a 3D printed object. It takes the sliced file (the gcode file) and the filament, then uses the gcode instructions to build the object one move at a time.","To achieve this, the 3D printer uses specialized heaters to melt the filament to very small widths and carefully deposit it onto a build plate (usually glass or another material) so that it can build upwards by putting down more layers of plastic down. Layer by layer, very slowly, an object is built up from the build plate. This process usually takes a long time; even small objects can take much longer than expected. Most small prints can be accomplished in 30 minutes to an hour; it's not uncommon for prints to take two, four, or even 24 hours to complete depending on the size and level of detail."]},{"l":"Wrapping Up","p":["In this post, we've covered some core concepts of 3D printing; what 3D printing actually looks like and what it entails.

All three sections have information that you might find useful, and we recommend reading it all before making a decision. Today's article will only be covering the first section."]},{"l":"Before The 3D Printer","p":["The first thing, even before which printer to get, is \"where will it go\"? A bedroom? The living room? The garage? A 3D printer requires a fair amount of space to itself; you'll need to make sure you can set aside space roughly the size of a coffee table where the printer will live. Remember that it's not just the machine that you'll need space for -- there will be tools, filament, and more that needs to be stored around or nearby the printer.","Filament is an even bigger question; though each roll isn't that big, it's easy to eventually wind up with more than expected. Some people opt for storage in closets or cabinets, while others opt for wall-mounted solutions that allow different spools to be easily grabbed.

Cats, dogs, and little humans will want to see what this new thing is that makes noise, and the extra plastic bits (we'll talk about how to deal with plastic waste later) are especially enticing. Most of the time, they'll investigate the machine and then move on, but some pets won't be able to leave it alone. Here's what you'll need to watch out for:"]},{"l":"Hot Parts","p":["The nozzle of a 3D printer (the tip of the print head where the plastic comes out) is typically unprotected and the average print head (called the \"hot end\") can reach 250C, which is ~ 482F. Most prints with PLA take place at or around 210˚C (410˚F), which means that little bit of metal is really hot for the entire process of printing. That will cause burns before you notice -- and they hurt! Most 3D printers also have a heated bed, but the temperatures are much lower: usually ~ 60˚C (140˚F) or lower. You'll want to make sure that hands or paws are not in danger of coming into prolonged contact while the machine is running. (To put this into perspective, your household water heats at a maximum of 120˚F, and safety experts suggest you keep it at an even lower temperature if you have little humans to prevent scalding. So we're talking about a range from a little hotter than household water to pizza-cooking oven heat here.)"]},{"l":"Plastic Waste","p":["After using the printer for a bit, you'll end up with strands of plastic (or little chunks) that aren't part of your finished pieces. These pieces are small enough to be choking hazards for pretty much everything, so it's important to make sure there is a plan for how to deal with them. A small container or trash can nearby will do the trick, but make sure it has a lid if there's any risk of someone going digging for something to play with."]},{"l":"Managing Hair","p":["Pets are great, but they frequently shed... everywhere. There's a good chance that a dog or cat checking out a running 3D printer will accidentally leave behind a token of their interest that you'll have to dig out of your finished prints or pick out of the machine. Hair sticks to the oil used in the moving parts of the machine, so you might have to do more maintenance."]},{"l":"Allergies","p":["You may have heard that PLA, the most popular plastic for 3D printing, is a corn byproduct. If you're worried about working with PLA because of corn allergies, you should know that there shouldn't be an issue; in the process of converting it to a plastic, the profilin (the allergen) is burned off and is not present in the final plastic."]},{"l":"Wrapping Up","p":["In this post, we've covered concerns and things to be aware of when identifying whether a 3D printer can fit neatly into your home.

Several surfaces exist, but here are the most common ones:","PEI, a mildly sticky plastic","Glass (just normal plate glass or a mirror)","Textured metal","Most 3D printers today either use PEI (a light orange color) or black textured plastic for cost purposes. Some nicer printers offer flexible textured metal build surfaces that are removable, though it's often available as an aftermarket upgrade.","A lot of printers, though mostly machines that are a few years old, use glass as the bed surface of choice. Hot plastic grips to glass very well and releases easily when it's cool. With a quick dash of some cheap hairspray, prints will stick to the glass with no problems.","The recommended brand of hairspray is Aqua Net Extra Super Hold -- you can usually find it for a dollar or two at Walmart or your local corner store. Keep in mind that you only need hairspray if your printer uses a glass or mirror build surface.","PEI and textured metal don't require any additional help to work, but may need cleaning from time to time. You'll want to pick up some 90%+ isopropyl alcohol to clean them -- you won't need much, as a single bottle will go a long way.","DO NOT use acetone to clean PEI or textured surfaces; they will be ruined permanently!","Other surfaces exist -- everything from machined stone to painter's tape -- but the above listed ones are what you're most likely to find. Hairspray also isn't the only thing you can use to change the properties of surfaces like glass; you can use purpose-built chemicals like 3D Gloop or even things you might already have around the house, like Elmer's Glue Stick!"]},{"l":"Getting Prints Off the Bed","p":["All that talking about different methods of getting prints to stick brings up a good question: how do we get them off the bed when they're done?","The most tried-and-true method is to use a sharpened scraper (like a paint scraper) or a purpose-built tool like this one from Gizmo Dorks. If you're careful, wedging a razor blade under the print will often release it without too much issue, but try to stick to tools that have handles for your safety (and the safety of those around you).","This is why some people opt for removable, flexible build plates; when the print is finished, you simply remove the build plate with the part on it, then carefully flex the plate -- the part pops off! Take a look at some example retrofit kits here or to see a printer that comes with them, check out the Prusa MK3S here."]},{"l":"Power Considerations","p":["When getting ready to run a 3D printer, it's important to remember that prints frequently last for hours at a time, and the printer can't lose power during the print. If you live in an area that is prone to brownouts or power outages, you may want to consider investing in an uninterruptible power supply to plug your printer into. This is definitely not a requirement (for reference, none of the printers I run are on uninterruptible power supplies) but may be something that you might need."]},{"i":"little-human-interference","l":"(Little) Human Interference","p":["Though we talked about little humans in the last post, we're revisiting this topic because playing with a 3D printer while it's off and playing with one while it's running are two very different things. 3D printers are very sensitive pieces of equipment, and if they're bumped or jostled while they're running, those movements will show up as defects in the finished print. It (most likely) won't ruin the work, but it certainly won't help.","As interested as small hands may be, it's important that they CANNOT interact with the printer while it's hot. They could severely burn themselves."]},{"l":"Noise Considerations","p":["A 3D printer is, almost without exception, not a quiet machine. It will hum, sing, and otherwise whirr its way through a print; some homes amplify these sounds and make them seem louder than they are due to their frequencies. Silencing a printer is a complex matter that can sometimes be accomplished through hardware upgrades or by running the machine slower... but nothing beats a little bit of foam. Check out this video from CNC Kitchen about quieting a 3D printer with a little bit of foam and a concrete tile."]},{"l":"Fire Hazards","p":["Anything that gets very hot can cause a fire, and 3D printers are no exception. Thankfully, the number of fires caused by printers is extremely low and there are some easy things you can do to help guard against the possibility of a fire:","Buy a small fire extinguisher -- these are what I use; keep it nearby to your printer in a place where it can be easily grabbed","Get a smoke detector and install it right above your machine","Make sure that the machine is plugged into a power strip or an outlet that you can easily reach if you have to unplug it quickly","Hopefully you should never have to deal with anything relating to fires or scares, but it's \"playing with fire\" to not invest in some adequate protection.

Every 3D printer has a different way of announcing that it's done with a job, but generally the important part is that the machine will move the hot end out of the way so you can access the part that just finished printing. This next part is so important it's going in its own little bubble:","You won't be able to remove a printed object from the build surface of the printer immediately when it's done -- you must wait for it to cool down. The part will get progressively easier to remove as the machine cools down; the sooner you try to remove it, the more you risk damaging your part and printer through brute force.","Sometimes a part will pop off the build plate after it cools down and you can pick it right up... but sometimes it will require some gentle (but firm) force. You'll want to use the print removal tool -- or, very carefully, a utility knife blade-- to get under the part so that it can lift off the build plate.","You'll want to make sure to be extra careful if you're using anything sharp; one wrong move and you'll damage the build plate, the part you just printed, or yourself. Sometimes removing a part can take a few minutes, so don't be discouraged.

Sometimes it will take several tries before you get a result that you're happy with, and that may require tweaking the physical printer or the settings in your slicer program.","Most of the time, print failures don't get very far! Image thanks to @tgibriday","The best way to approach this when it happens is to clean up the plastic spaghetti and try again. It's important to watch at least the first layer get printed, as most failures will happen at this time. There are many, many different things that could be wrong (nozzle too close to the bed, nozzle too far away from the bed, wrong temperatures, oil on the build surface, etc.) It's also a great idea to check on things occasionally just to make sure that it's still trundling along.","Sometimes they're a bit more effort to clean up -- this one wasn't caught for several hours.

It's plastic used to make sure that everything is flowing correctly, plastic used to make sure that prints are adhering to the bed, or plastic used to make sure that a color change has worked. There's no use in keeping any of this, so it goes straight into the trash. You'll want to keep a small trash can nearby so that you have somewhere handy to throw these bits -- they accumulate startlingly fast.","There will also be other trash from things like new spools or new parts if you tinker with the machine a lot; all that will also need to find a new home in the trash can."]},{"l":"Cleaning Up Your Prints","p":["Not every 3D print comes off the printer looking amazing -- there may be some extra work that should happen. Small strings can be vaporized with a hairdryer set to \"hot\" and little blobs can pop off with a little help from a hobby knife.","If you don't already have a hobby knife (commonly sold under the brand names X-Acto and Excel), we recommend one that tightens at the back of the knife instead of at the blade. This type also commonly has a small metal plate that stops it from rolling on the table!

If that's the case, there may be a few pieces that fit together with screws or glue. Screws are easier because they don't usually scuff up the surface of your work, but they have extra costs in actually buying the hardware... so sometimes that just leaves glue as the next best option. If gluing together parts is something that you're interested in doing, you'll want to put some plastic-specific glues on your wishlist; something like 3D Gloop may be a good place to start.","Although it may be tempting, be careful when using superglue (sometimes called cyanoacrylate or just \"CA\" glue) -- it's really good at what it does, but reacts badly with most plastics and leaves white blemishes everywhere it touches. That may not be an issue depending on what you're gluing together, but it's worth noting.","Sometimes prints just don't have enough pizzazz if they're just the color of the plastic, so painting might be the next step.
